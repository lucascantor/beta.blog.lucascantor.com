<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">fdesetup</code> utility can be used to remotely restart a Mac without needing physical in-person keyboard access to unlock FileVault on the next boot only:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fdesetup authrestart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will be prompted for the password of a FileVault-enabled user account, or the FileVault recovery key.</p>

<p>After restarting, macOS will allow remote access via SSH immediately, without the usual need to unlock FileVault by logging in as a FileVault-enabled user sitting in front of the Mac in question. This is particularly useful for headless Mac mini servers, so you donâ€™t need to connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse every single time they restart due to a software update, for example.</p>

<p>Bonus - you can do this on Windows as well, with PowerShell:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>PowerShell -Command "Suspend-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:" -RebootCount 1"
shutdown /r /f
</code></pre></div></div>
